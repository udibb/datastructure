Naming
Claim:      a claim to a dibb
            it claimed by a User, on a Contender, and about a Dibb
Comment:    a comment
            it is written by a User, on a Claim, and it can be liked by many other Users
Confirm:    an action a user does to a claim
            pretty much invisible: a link between a User and a Claim that the user wants to confirm
Contender:  the object of a claim
            it is linked to a User or Nonuser, and is the object of a Claim
Dibb:       duh
            a list of Claims
Like:       an action a user does to a comment
            pretty much invisible: a link between a User and a Comment that the user wants to like
Nonuser:    something that is trying to get a dibb
            has a Condender and is a Contendent
User:       duh
            has ownership of pretty much everything, can be a Contendent


Contender vs Contendent vs Claim vs User/Nonuser
A Contender is the object of a Claim, while a Dibb is the subject of a Claim.
A Contendent is the content of the Contender: a User (or Nonuser) can be a Contendent and therefore linked to by a Contender.
